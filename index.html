            <p>I am a people person. I really like to meet and work with lots of different people.I like to be sure that everything is just right and that I pay attention to all the details. I am my biggest critic if i do something wrong or if I miss something right in front of me.I am a creative thinker. I have an open mind about what will work best and I like to explore alternative solutions to problems.</p>

            <p>I am efficient and like to be organized. This ensures that I am as productive as possible on the job.I enjoy solving problems,troubleshooting issues, and finding solutions in a as short a time as possible.</p>
